  # This is precisely the `build-local-artifacts` job that lived in
  # `release.yml`, generated from `dist generate` when `build-local-artifacts =
  # true` in `dist-workspace.toml`, except we've swapped `needs.plan` for
  # `inputs.plan`. It should be easy to update as required by swapping
  # `build-local-artifacts` back to `true` and rerunning `dist generate`, then
  # copying over the `build-local-artifacts` job it generates.
