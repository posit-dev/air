# Opening brace is moved back onto the first line because this is a test call
test_that("description that is super long and actually exceeds the line limit but we arent going to break!",

# Both arguments are reflowed because this is a test call

# it gets expanded
# TODO: The expansion doesn't look right though
test_that(identity("description that is super long and actually exceeds the line limit but we arent going to break!"), {
