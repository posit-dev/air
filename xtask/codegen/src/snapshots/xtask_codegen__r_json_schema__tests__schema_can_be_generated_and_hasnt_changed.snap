For example, if your\n `air.toml` was located at `root/air.toml`, then:\n\n - `file.R` excludes a file named `file.R` located anywhere below `root/`. This is\n   equivalent to `**/file.R`.\n\n - `folder/` excludes a directory named `folder` (and all of its children) located\n   anywhere below `root/`. You can also just use `folder`, but this would\n   technically also match a file named `folder`, so the trailing slash is preferred\n   when targeting directories. This is equivalent to `**/folder/`.\n\n - `/file.R` excludes a file named `file.R` located at `root/file.R`.\n\n - `/folder/` excludes a directory named `folder` (and all of its children) located\n   at `root/folder/`.\n\n - `file-*.R` excludes R files named like `file-this.R` and `file-that.R` located\n   anywhere below `root/`.\n\n - `folder/*.R` excludes all R files located at `root/folder/`. Note that R files\n   in directories under `folder/` are not excluded in this case (such as\n   `root/folder/subfolder/file.R`).\n\n - `folder/**/*.R` excludes all R files located anywhere below `root/folder/`.\n\n - `**/folder/*.R` excludes all R files located directly inside a `folder/`\n   directory, where the `folder/` directory itself can /// appear anywhere.\n\n See the full [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) documentation for\n all of the patterns you can provide.",
