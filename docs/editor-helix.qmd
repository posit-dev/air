[Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) is a modal editor with builtin support for the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/). Adding support for new language servers is relatively easy via a .toml configuration file. 

# Installation

First, install the Air [command line tool](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/cli.html). Version `â‰¥0.4.1` of Air is needed for proper Helix support ([#246](https://github.com/posit-dev/air/issues/246)). 

Add the following to your `languages.toml` file:

``` toml
[language-server.air]
command = "air"
args = ["language-server"]

[[language]]
name = "r"
language-servers = ["air"]
```

## `languageserver`

Currently Air only supports formatting. It's possible to use Air and [`languageserver`](https://github.com/REditorSupport/languageserver) simultaneously for a better editing experience. Use the following configuration to enable both language servers (make sure that `languageserver` is installed, Helix is able to use it without any additional configuration).
``` toml
[[language]]
name = "r"
language-servers = ["air", "r"]
```

# Features

## Format on save

Add `auto-format = true` to your R language configuration block.

```toml 
[[language]]
name = "r"
language-servers = ["air"]
auto-format = true
```
