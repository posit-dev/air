[Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) is a modal editor with builtin support for the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).

# Installation

::: callout-note
## Air â‰¥0.4.1 is needed for proper Helix support.
:::

First, install the Air [command line tool](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/cli.html).

Add the following to your Helix [languages.toml](https://docs.helix-editor.com/languages.html):

``` toml
[language-server.air]
command = "air"
args = ["language-server"]

[[language]]
name = "r"
language-servers = ["air"]
```

## `languageserver`

Currently, Air only supports formatting.
It's possible to use Air and [`languageserver`](https://github.com/REditorSupport/languageserver) simultaneously for a better editing experience.
Use the following configuration to enable both language servers (make sure that the `languageserver` R package is installed, Helix is able to use it without any additional configuration).

``` toml
[[language]]
name = "r"
language-servers = ["air", "r"]
```

# Features

## Format on save

Add `auto-format = true` to your R language configuration block to enable formatting on save.

``` toml
[[language]]
name = "r"
language-servers = ["air"]
auto-format = true
```
