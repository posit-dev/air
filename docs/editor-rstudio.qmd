RStudio does not support the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), but you can still use Air as an *external formatter*.

# Installation

::: callout-note
## Air is currently only supported on macOS and Windows. Linux support is coming soon!
:::

Ensure you have at least RStudio version 2024.12.0, which you can download from [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
Additionally, you'll need to install the Air [command line tool](cli.qmd).

Open `Tools -> Global Options -> Code` and change the option to use an `External` formatter.
Then set the `Reformat command` to {`path/to/air} format`.

The easiest way to figure out `{path/to/air}` for yourself is to run `which air` from a Terminal on Unix, and `where air` from the Command Prompt on Windows.

# Features

## Format on save

After you've set Air as an external formatter, you can either tell RStudio to format all documents on save, or set this on a per document basis.

To format all documents on save, open `Tools -> Global Options -> Code -> Saving` and check `Reformat documents on save`.

To format individual documents on save, open the file specific settings and check `Reformat Document on Save`.

## Quarto

There is currently no way to use Air in RStudio with Quarto documents.
