Air provides first class support for Neovim, which supports the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).

# Installation

First, install the Air [command line tool](cli.qmd).

We recommend configuring Air as an LSP server via [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig).
While the Air language server currently only supports formatting, it will gain more features in future.
Add the following to your `init.lua`:

``` lua
require("lspconfig").air.setup({
    on_attach = function(_, bufnr)
        vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("BufWritePre", {
            buffer = bufnr,
            callback = function()
                vim.lsp.buf.format()
            end,
        })
    end,
})
```

While not required, the `BufWritePre` command ensures that Air automatically formats your R code when you save a file.

## `languageserver`

If both Air and `languageserver` are installed, you can use the following configuration to disable `languageserver` formatting, ensuring that only Air handles formatting:

``` lua
require("lspconfig").r_language_server.setup({
    on_attach = function(client, _)
        client.server_capabilities.documentFormattingProvider = false
        client.server_capabilities.documentRangeFormattingProvider = false
    end,
})
```

# Features

## Format on save

With the `BufWritePre` hook recommended in the configuration step, Air will format your R files on every save.

## Quarto

As an LSP, Air itself does not provide direct support for Quarto or RMarkdown documents.
However, Air can additionally be configured as a formatter plugin for [conform.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim), which supports ["injected language formatting"](https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim/blob/master/doc/advanced_topics.md#injected-language-formatting-code-blocks) for code blocks in Markdown, Quarto, and RMarkdown.
Conform can be configured by adding the following to your `nvim/lua/plugins/conform.lua`:

``` lua
require("conform").setup({
    formatters_by_ft = {
        r = { "air" },
    },
})
```

See the [conform.nvim documentation](https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for more information on how to configure conform.nvim with your favorite plugin manager.
