# Installing the Air server

First, install Air by following the instructions on the [Air CLI documentation](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/cli.html).
The CLI binary bundles the Air server as well as a command line formatting tool.

# Configuration

Air can be configured as a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server via [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) or as a formatter plugin via [conform.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim).

## LSP Configuration with nvim-lspconfig

To configure the client side to use Air's language server, add the following to your configuration.
This ensures that Air automatically formats R code when you save a file:

``` lua
require("lspconfig").air.setup({
    on_attach = function(_, bufnr)
        vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("BufWritePre", {
            buffer = bufnr,
            callback = function()
                vim.lsp.buf.format()
            end,
        })
    end,
})
```

This is the recommended way to use Air.
While the language server currently only supports formatting, it will gain more features in future.

If both `Air` and `languageserver` are installed, you can use the following configuration to disable languageserver formatting, ensuring that only Air handles formatting:

``` lua
require("lspconfig").r_language_server.setup({
    on_attach = function(client, _)
        client.server_capabilities.documentFormattingProvider = false
        client.server_capabilities.documentRangeFormattingProvider = false
    end,
})
```

## conform.nvim configuration

Air can be configured as a formatter plugin via [conform.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim).
This allows you to format R code with Air inside code chunks in Quarto and RMarkdown documents.
It can be configured by adding the following to your `nvim/lua/plugins/conform.lua`:

``` lua
require("conform").setup({
    formatters_by_ft = {
        r = { "air" },
    },
})
```

See the [conform.nvim documentation](https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for more information on how to configure conform.nvim with your favorite plugin manager.
