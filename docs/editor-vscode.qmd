Air provides first class support for both VS Code and Positron, which both support the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).

# Installation

Air is available [as an Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Posit.air-vscode) for both VS Code and Positron.
The extension comes pre-bundled with an Air binary, so you don't need anything else to get going!
The Air extension is hosted in the VS Code Marketplace and on OpenVSX.

# Features

## Format on save

Once you have the extension installed, turn on Format on Save for R documents by opening your `settings.json` and adding:

``` json
{
    "[r]": {
        "editor.formatOnSave": true
    }
}
```

You should now be able to simply open an R document, save it, and have the entire document formatted by Air.
You can also explicitly call the command `Format Document` if you'd like to control this manually.

To open your `settings.json` file, run one of the following from the Command Palette:

-   Run `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)` to modify global user settings.
-   Run `Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)` to modify project specific settings.
    You may prefer this instead of setting the user level setting if you drop in on multiple projects, but not all of them use Air. Similarly, if you work on a project with collaborators, we [recommend](configuration.qmd "Configuration recommendations") that you set project specific settings and check in these project specific settings to your repository to ensure that every collaborator is using the same formatting settings.

## Format selection

To format a selection of code, highlight it with your cursor and run the command `Format Selection`.
Formatting a selection may *expand* that selection to find the nearest complete fragment of code that is formattable.

## Format workspace folder

Air ships with a special `Air: Format Workspace Folder` command to format all R files within a workspace folder.
This is particularly useful when transitioning an existing project over to Air, where you need to perform a project-wide format before utilizing the per-file format on save feature.

Note that if you don't have an `air.toml` in your project, then this command will use Air's default settings rather than the IDE [settings synchronization mechanism](configuration.qmd#configuration-settings-synchronization).
We recommend using `usethis::use_air()` to set up an `air.toml` (among other things) before running this command.

## Quarto

Quarto can automatically invoke Air on R code cells when the [Quarto extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto) is active.

### Format on save

To format all R code cells on save, set this in your `settings.json`:

``` json
{
    "[quarto]": {
        "editor.formatOnSave": true
    },
    "[r]": {
        "editor.formatOnSave": true
    }
}
```

### Format cell

When inside an R cell in a Quarto document, use the chorded key combination `Cmd+K Cmd+F` or the command `Quarto: Format Cell` to format a single cell.

## Configuration autocompletion and validation

Installing the [Even Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml) extension activates autocompletion and validation while inside an `air.toml` file.
There is a [known issue](https://github.com/tamasfe/taplo/issues/514) regarding autocompletion duplication, but we still find this extension very useful!
