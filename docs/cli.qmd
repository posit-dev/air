# Installation

If you'd like to use Air at the command line, you can use one of our standalone installers.

On macOS and Linux:

``` bash
curl -LsSf https://github.com/posit-dev/air/releases/latest/download/air-installer.sh | sh
```

Or, if you're familiar with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), install the [air formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/air) with:

```bash
brew install air
```

On Windows:

``` powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://github.com/posit-dev/air/releases/latest/download/air-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

For a specific version:

``` bash
curl -LsSf https://github.com/posit-dev/air/releases/download/0.1.1/air-installer.sh | sh
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://github.com/posit-dev/air/releases/download/0.1.1/air-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

The installer scripts will automatically add Air to your `PATH`.
The very first time you install Air, for the `PATH` modifications to be applied you'll need to restart your terminal.

Note that if you'd like to use Air inside VS Code or Positron, then the Extension for those editors comes pre-bundled with an Air binary, so there's nothing you need to do besides [download the Extension](editor-vscode.qmd).
