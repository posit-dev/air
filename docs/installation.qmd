If you'd like to use Air at the command line, you can use one of our standalone installers.

```{=html}
<!--
# Uncomment after we support this

Note that if you'd like to use Air inside VS Code or Positron, then the Extension for those editors comes pre-bundled with an Air binary, so there's nothing you need to do besides [download the Extension](editors.qmd).
-->
```

To install Air as a command line tool:

On macOS and Linux:

``` bash
curl -LsSf https://github.com/posit-dev/air/releases/latest/download/air-installer.sh | sh
```

On Windows:

``` powershell
powershell -c "irm https://github.com/posit-dev/air/releases/latest/download/air-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

For a specific version:

``` bash
curl -LsSf https://github.com/posit-dev/air/releases/download/0.1.1/air-installer.sh | sh
powershell -c "irm https://github.com/posit-dev/air/releases/download/0.1.1/air-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

The installer scripts will automatically add Air to your `PATH`.
The very first time you install Air, for the `PATH` modifications to be applied you'll need to restart your terminal.

On Windows, the first time you install Air it requires a full system restart for the `PATH` modification to take effect.
We are working on improving this.
